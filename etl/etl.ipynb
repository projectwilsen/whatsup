However, studies show that RAG is not\\nconsistently effective and can even mislead LLMs due to noisy or incorrect\\nretrieved texts. This suggests that RAG possesses a duality including both\\nbenefit and detriment. Although many existing methods attempt to address this\\nissue, they lack a theoretical explanation for the duality in RAG. The benefit\\nand detriment within this duality remain a black box that cannot be quantified\\nor compared in an explainable manner. This paper takes the first step in\\ntheoretically giving the essential explanation of benefit and detriment in RAG\\nby: (1) decoupling and formalizing them from RAG prediction, (2) approximating\\nthe gap between their values by representation similarity and (3) establishing\\nthe trade-off mechanism between them, to make them explainable, quantifiable,\\nand comparable. We demonstrate that the distribution difference between\\nretrieved texts and LLMs' knowledge acts as double-edged sword, bringing both\\nbenefit and detriment. We also prove that the actual effect of RAG can be\\npredicted at token level. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel\\nmethod, X-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between pure LLM and RAG\\nat token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in\\nreal-world tasks based on LLMs including OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the\\neffectiveness of our method and support our theoretical results.\", comment='23 pages', journal_ref=None, doi=None, primary_category='cs.CL', categories=['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.IR'], links=[arxiv.Result.Link('http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00944v1', title=None, rel='alternate', content_type=None), arxiv.Result.Link('http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00944v1', title='pdf', rel='related', content_type=None)]),\n",

This approach\\ninvolves retrieving relevant information from a large, up-to-date dataset and\\nusing it to enhance the generation process, leading to more accurate and\\ncontextually appropriate responses. Despite its benefits, RAG introduces a new\\nattack surface for LLMs, particularly because RAG databases are often sourced\\nfrom public data, such as the web. In this paper, we propose \\\\TrojRAG{} to\\nidentify the vulnerabilities and attacks on retrieval parts (RAG database) and\\ntheir indirect attacks on generative parts (LLMs). Specifically, we identify\\nthat poisoning several customized content passages could achieve a retrieval\\nbackdoor, where the retrieval works well for clean queries but always returns\\ncustomized poisoned adversarial queries. Triggers and poisoned passages can be\\nhighly customized to implement various attacks. For example, a trigger could be\\na semantic group like \"The Republican Party, Donald Trump, etc.\" Adversarial\\npassages can be tailored to different contents, not only linked to the triggers\\nbut also used to indirectly attack generative LLMs without modifying them.\\nThese attacks can include denial-of-service attacks on RAG and semantic\\nsteering attacks on LLM generations conditioned by the triggers. Our\\nexperiments demonstrate that by just poisoning 10 adversarial passages can\\ninduce 98.2\\\\% success rate to retrieve the adversarial passages.
